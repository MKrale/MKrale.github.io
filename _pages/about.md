I'm Merlijn Krale, a PhD Candidate at the <a href='https://sws.cs.ru.nl/HomePage'>Department of Software Science (SWS)</a> at <a href='https://www.ru.nl/en'>Radboud University Nijmegen</a>.
I'm supervised by <a href='https://nilsjansen.org/'>Dr. Nils Jansen</a> and <a href="https://tdsimao.github.io/">Dr. Thiago D. Sim√£o </a>, and part of the research group <a href='https://AI-FM.org/'>AI-FM</a>.

In my research, I focus on model-based algorithms with strong theoretical foundations for complex decision-making processes, with a particular interest in dealing with (epistemic) uncertainty.
Currently, I'm researching *Active Measure* environments, which are partially-observable settings where agents have explicit control over their observations.
More broadly, topics of interest include other partially observable environments, as well as algorithms that include robustness or safety specifications in addition to their other goals
